Game Shelf v1.2.0.15 Release Notes
===================================
Released: January 22, 2026

CHANGES FROM v1.2.0.14:
-----------------------
BATTLE INTEGRITY GUARDRAILS:

1. Entry Fee Limits
   - Private battles: Max 5 coins (was up to 50)
   - Public battles: Always free (entry fee disabled)
   - Rationale: Keeps it a "friendly wager" like golf or office pools
   
2. UI Changes
   - Entry fee dropdown: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5 coins only
   - Added note under entry fee explaining the max
   - When public is selected, entry fee dropdown disabled
   - Public battles always show "🆓 Free" in listings
   
3. Honor System Messaging
   - New "🤝 Community Honor System" notice in create battle form
   - New "🤝 Honor System" section in battle rules
   - Explains: "Battles run on trust, like a friendly golf wager.
     There's no automated verification - the community polices itself."
   
4. Backend Safeguards
   - createBattle() forces entryFee=0 for public battles
   - createBattle() caps entryFee at 5 for private battles
   - Even if UI is bypassed, server-side logic enforces limits

RATIONALE:
- Main cheat vector (play on device A, get answer, replay on B) is undetectable
- Low stakes remove incentive to cheat
- Public battles (strangers) have no coin stakes
- Private battles (friends) have social accountability
- No false sense of security from ineffective "anti-cheat"
