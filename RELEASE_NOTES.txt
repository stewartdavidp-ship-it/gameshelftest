Game Shelf v1.2.0.8 Release Notes
==================================
Released: January 22, 2026

CHANGES FROM v1.2.0.7:
----------------------
- Redesigned clipboard detection with "diff" approach
  - Captures clipboard state when leaving the app
  - On return, compares current vs captured to detect new content
  - Only prompts if clipboard actually changed (no more false prompts)
  
- New functions:
  - captureClipboardOnLeave() - saves clipboard state on app hide
  - checkClipboardOnReturn() - compares clipboard on app visible
  - checkClipboardOnInit() - handles "copy then open app" flow
  - tapToLogClipboardWithDiff() - iOS tap handler with diff check
  - showTapToLogCardForClipboardCheck() - iOS gesture prompt

- Edge cases handled:
  - User leaves without copying: no prompt on return ✓
  - User copies result then returns: prompt to log ✓
  - User closes app, copies result, reopens: prompt to log ✓
  - User has old content from yesterday: no prompt ✓
