Game Shelf v1.2.17
==================
Release Date: January 25, 2026

AI HINT HELPER (NEW FEATURE!)
-----------------------------
- 💡 Floating Action Button (FAB) appears when hint data is available
- Bottom sheet UI for getting AI-powered hints
- Integrated with Game Shelf original games (Quotle, Rungs, Slate)
- Auto-detects puzzle data from localStorage
- 10-level hint system (Whisper → Answer)
- "Still Stuck" auto-escalates to next hint level
- Supports NYT games via web search:
  - Connections, Wordle, Strands
  - Spelling Bee, Mini Crossword
- Hint history tracking per session
- Game selector chips for switching games

HOW IT WORKS
------------
1. Play a Game Shelf game (Quotle, Rungs, or Slate)
2. Game stores puzzle data to localStorage
3. Return to Game Shelf
4. 💡 FAB appears (bottom right)
5. Tap FAB → Select hint level → Get AI hint
6. Still stuck? Tap "Still Stuck" for stronger hint

TECHNICAL NOTES
---------------
- Games now call storeHintData() on load
- Data stored as gameshelf_hint_data key
- FAB visibility based on data recency (24h)
- Uses Claude API with web search for NYT games
- Respects puzzle integrity (only hints, no spoilers at low levels)
