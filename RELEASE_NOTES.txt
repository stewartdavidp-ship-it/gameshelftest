Game Shelf v1.2.0.24
====================
Release Date: January 22, 2025

CLIPBOARD COMPARISON FIX
------------------------
Fixed race condition where clipboard state wasn't being captured
before launching a game.

Bug Fix:
- Added `captureClipboardOnLeave()` call in `launchGame()` function
- Ensures clipboard baseline is captured BEFORE opening game URL
- Previously relied only on visibilitychange event which could fire
  after the new tab/app was already open

This fixes the issue where the app wasn't properly detecting new 
clipboard content when returning from a game.

Previous Changes (v1.2.0.23):
- Force Update option in Settings > Data
- updateViaCache: 'none' for faster SW updates

Previous Changes (v1.2.0.22):
- UAT Mode with floating feedback button
- Debug context auto-capture for issue reports
