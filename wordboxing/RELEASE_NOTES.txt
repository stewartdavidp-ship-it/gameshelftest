DEBUG FEATURE - "Stuck?" Button
-------------------------------
- Added floating "Stuck?" button in bottom-left corner during active games

- On confirm:
  - Captures sanitized game state snapshot (no actual words/letters)
  - Submits debug report to Firebase at `debug-reports/`
  - Cleans up local game state and listeners

Debug report includes:
- Game code, phase, round, turn state

- Timestamp and app version
